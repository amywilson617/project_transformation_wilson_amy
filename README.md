# Resources
* I referenced my own projects from last semester.
* I did not use any other resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

# Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
* No comments, other than that I prefer to work with my own original HTML. This was a challenge using someone else's existing HTML.
